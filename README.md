## 📌 Project Description

This project is designed to classify images of popular sports celebrities using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** powered by **Transfer Learning**. 

The model focuses on faces detected in the images, ensuring accurate classification even with variations in backgrounds, lighting, and camera angles.

The application allows users to:
- Upload an image.
- Automatically detect and crop the face.
- Classify the image using a pre-trained deep learning model.
